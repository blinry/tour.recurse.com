# Tour of RC

This is a virtual photo tour of the physical RC space, originally taken on a Saturday night at the end of my SP2'19 batch.

## How to add photos to the map:

1. Drop your photo into the *photos* directory.
2. Click on the position where your photo should be linked on the map. The map coordinate will be displayed in the top bar.
3. Add an entry to *script.js* in the following format:
    
        {x: 123, y: 456, img: "filename.jpg"},
4. Feel free to move around other photos a bit if you think they could be arranged better!
